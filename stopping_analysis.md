# Premature Stopping Analysis in 2048 Reward Sweep

## What Was Happening

The original reward sweep script included **premature stopping logic** that would terminate training early for configurations that appeared to be performing poorly:

```python
# Original stopping logic (lines 195-200 in src/reward_sweep.py)
if total_steps >= MIN_STEPS and mean_reward < CUTOFF_FRAC * best_so_far:
    print(f"{sweep_id}: Stopped early (mean_reward < {CUTOFF_FRAC*100:.0f}% of best)")
    stopped_dict[sweep_id] = True
    break
```

### Stopping Criteria:
- **MIN_STEPS**: 40,000 steps (minimum training before stopping allowed)
- **CUTOFF_FRAC**: 0.5 (50% of best performing configuration)
- **Logic**: If a configuration's mean reward drops below 50% of the best configuration after 40k steps, stop training

## Why This Was Problematic

### 1. **Sample Size Imbalance**
From our analysis:
- **Sweep 3**: 260 games (full training)
- **Sweeps 1, 4, 5**: 20 games each (stopped early)
- **Sweep 2**: 40 games (stopped early)

This created an unfair comparison where the "best" configuration had 13x more training data.

### 2. **Premature Termination**
The stopping logic assumed that if a configuration wasn't performing well by 40k steps, it wouldn't improve. However:
- **Learning curves can be non-monotonic**
- **Some configurations might need more time to converge**
- **The "best" configuration was determined early, creating bias**

### 3. **Statistical Bias**
The system created a self-reinforcing bias:
1. First configuration trains fully
2. Later configurations get compared against it
3. If they don't match early performance, they get stopped
4. This reinforces the first configuration as "best"

## Evidence from Your Results

### Sample Size Impact:
```
Sweep 3 (260 games): Mean reward = 4,238.05
Sweep 2 (40 games):  Mean reward = 1,484.52
Sweep 1 (20 games):  Mean reward = 930.78
```

The correlation between sample size and performance suggests the stopping logic was artificially limiting the potential of other configurations.

### Performance Distribution:
- **Sweep 3**: 44 games with very high rewards (>10,000)
- **Other sweeps**: Much fewer high-reward games

This suggests that given equal training time, other configurations might have achieved similar performance.

## Benefits of Removing Premature Stopping

### 1. **Fair Comparison**
All configurations will train for the full 250,000 steps, allowing:
- Equal opportunity for all parameter combinations
- Proper statistical comparison
- Discovery of late-blooming configurations

### 2. **Better Statistical Power**
With consistent sample sizes, we can:
- Make reliable comparisons between configurations
- Calculate confidence intervals
- Identify truly significant differences

### 3. **Discovery of Optimal Configurations**
Some configurations might:
- Start slowly but improve dramatically
- Have different learning curves
- Require more time to reach their potential

## Modified Script

I've created `src/reward_sweep_no_stopping.py` which:
- Removes the `CUTOFF_FRAC` logic
- Allows all configurations to train for full `MAX_STEPS` (250,000)
- Maintains the same evaluation frequency
- Provides fair comparison across all parameter combinations

## Recommendations

### 1. **Run the Modified Script**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python src/reward_sweep_no_stopping.py
```

### 2. **Expected Improvements**
- More consistent sample sizes across configurations
- Better statistical reliability
- Potential discovery of new optimal configurations
- More accurate parameter sensitivity analysis

### 3. **Time Investment**
- **Original**: Variable time (some stopped early)
- **Modified**: ~5 configurations Ã— 250k steps each
- **Trade-off**: Longer runtime for more reliable results

### 4. **Monitoring**
The modified script will show:
- All configurations training for full duration
- Consistent evaluation every 20k steps
- Fair comparison of final results

## Conclusion

The premature stopping logic was likely introduced to save time on slower hardware, but it created significant statistical bias in your results. Removing it should provide much more reliable insights into which parameter configurations truly perform best for your 2048 AI.

The fact that sweep_3 had 260 games while others had only 20-40 games strongly suggests that the stopping logic was preventing other configurations from reaching their full potential.
